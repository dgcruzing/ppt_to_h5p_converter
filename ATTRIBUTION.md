###Attribution

This project was built with the assistance of Claude, an AI assistant, utilizing its new artifacts ability. The development was inspired by the work of MM-Lehmann's pptx2h5p project.
The combination of brainstorming with Claude and working with the H5P libraries aims to significantly reduce development time for educators who use this tool.

-MM-Lehmann for the inspiration from the [pptx2h5p project](https://github.com/MM-Lehmann/pptx2h5p)
-The H5P community for their excellent libraries and documentation

I hope this tool proves useful in shortening development time for educators creating H5P content from PowerPoint presentations.
